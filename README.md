# Pixel art icons
My pixel art icons which you can use yourself by importing a single css file!

In .SVG format so that you can manipulate the icons via CSS.

⚠️ This is made for myself so it's not as optimized as it could be and is a very small library.

## Credits

[Pixels to SVG](https://codepen.io/shshaw/pen/XbxvNj) to convert .PNG pixel arts to .SVG properly.
